   - Select "Open" from the context menu
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog

## Why the Security Warning?
The app shows a security warning because it's signed with a development certificate. This is normal for open-source apps that aren't distributed through the Mac App Store. The app is completely safe to use, and macOS will remember your choice after the first launch.
